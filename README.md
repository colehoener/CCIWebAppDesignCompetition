## Challenge

To design a UI/UX that allows users to "mix and match" certficate programs to arrive at a master's degree.

## Interface Design Document

The Interface Design Document (IDD) outlines the UI/UX design. A detailed description of each component, the flow of the interface, and user testing can be found in  [this document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tLH_S0slRSVoa6Um1QE72Btmt2rOPIrkF7FQq3MfIAk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Additional Information

### Challenges

While creating the UI/UX, staying within the constraints, while creating a user friendly design proved to be difficult. We found that displaying all the information a user would need to know was challenging, since it quickly made the UI feel cluttered. While designing the general layout and flow of the web app, another issue arose. We figured that while the requirements state that the user needs to only select certficates to arrive at degrees, it would be benifical to be able to go in the reverse direction. That is, select master's degrees to understand what is required to arrive at them. The design we created follows the original constraints and requirements while adding to the user experience in a logical way.
