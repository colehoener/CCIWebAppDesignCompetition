## Additional Information

### Challenges

While creating the UI/UX, staying within the constraints while creating a user friendly desgin proved to be difficult. We found that displaying all the information a user would need to know was diffcult since it quickly made the UI feel cluttered. While designing the general layout and flow of the web app, another issue arose. We figured that while the requirments state that the user needs to only select certficates to arrive at degrees, it would be benifical to be able to go in the reverse direction. That is, select master's degrees to understand what is required to arrive at them. The design we created follows the orginal contraints and requirments while adding to it in a logical way.
